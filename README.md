## Coding

### Visual Studio Code
[Download]()  
Visual Studio Code is my main code editor. I also use it for my note/blog writing also.
So I have a dedicated post for it [here]()

### Tabby
[Download](https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby)   
Tabby is the terminal which is run on multiple platform. I found it works very well on windows as well as Mac or Linux.
So I use it as my main terminal.  
I use it almost with default settings here is my little changes in configs:   
- font-size: 18  
- color scheme: `Firewatch`

### Table Plus
[Download](https://tableplus.com/)  
Table Plus is a database UI client. I use it to connect with database server in my develop process.
It is very easy to use and support many different databases.
It is developed by Vietnammese developers.
I also pay the premium version of it.

### Windows Sub-system Linux
**Deprecated** as I no longer using wsl anymore, I mostly using windows to connect and work on a remote server.

### Popcorn Time 
[Download](https://github.com/popcorn-official/popcorn-desktop)
- This software is very awesome to watch movie as it use torrent file and streaming directly to your computer. However you will need a strong internet connection in order to watch the movie smoothly. Also as it is using torrent, you will need other peers to seed it for you. 

## Tool
A list of tool to make working with Windows is more comfortable.

### Windir Stats
[Download]()
- This software is very useful to check disk storage to find out which files are taking space. I use this to detect large files and clean up.

## Utilities

### Windows Power Toys
[Dowload](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys)
- Windows Power Toys help re-keymap natively on Windows, I use it to remap my `caplocks` to `esc`, I don't use `caplocks` any time
- Windows Power Toys also has Power Toys run, trigger by `alt+space` which is very similar to Mac Spotlight. However, it is still lack of dictionary function (at the time I wrote this 21 July, 2022). I often use it in Mac
